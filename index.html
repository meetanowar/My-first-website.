        <h1 style="margin: 0;">Hello! This is Anowar </h1>
        <p>Hi I’m Anowar from Narsingdi, Dhaka-Bangladesh. I am a student in the honors fourth year of the zoology department at Govt. Shaheed Asad college, Shibpur, under the national university. We live in a populated country. We have enough educated people but we don’t have sufficient job sectors to provide them a job. So need to work on it to get rid of the unemployment problem in our country. In that case, freelancing can be a good choice for educated unemployed people.</p>

    <p> I have chosen 'Shikhbe sobai' to learn freelancing. There are some specific reasons to choosing 'Shikhbe sobai' like they have a great experience in it since they trained many people to be a successful freelancer. They also have great mentors and a 24/7 support system. Also, they provide lab facilities all 7 days a week with a proper internet connection which is a great chance to learn freelancing for a beginner.
So why you are hesitating to learn and say bad jabe na kew shikhbe sobai
